# Data Analysis Bootcamp 

## **ðŸ“– Learning Outcomes**

The bootcamp provided hands-on experience in data visualization, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and big data technologies. Emphasis was placed on leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to analyze and interpret complex datasets.

### **Data Visualization & Trend Analysis**
- Created and analyzed various charts, including line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
- Explored trends in life expectancy, income distribution, and mobile phone adoption.
- Implemented dynamic storytelling techniques, such as animated bubble charts, for better data interpretation.
- Faced challenges with missing values, scale adjustments, and overlapping data points, leading to improvements in data cleaning and formatting.

### **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Utilized Pandas for handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing inconsistent data.
- Explored feature engineering techniques like binning, scaling, and one-hot encoding to improve model performance.
- Understood the impact of biased data and methods to identify and mitigate bias in datasets.
- Improved dataset readiness by addressing outliers and inconsistencies before deeper analysis.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Correlation Analysis**
- Performed EDA using statistical summaries and various visualization techniques.
- Generated histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to identify distribution patterns and anomalies.
- Used correlation heatmaps to detect relationships between variables, reinforcing the importance of distinguishing correlation from causation.
- Addressed challenges in managing mixed data types and handling skewed distributions.

### **Big Data & Customer Churn Analysis**
- Gained insights into big data concepts, including structured vs. unstructured data, data bias, and ETL processes.
- Analyzed customer churn by identifying key predictors and trends within telecom datasets.
- Developed strategies for customer segmentation and retention based on data insights.
- Understood the role of batch vs. streaming data processing in large-scale datasets.

### **Interactive Data Dashboards & Business Insights**
- Designed interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash and Streamlit for real-time data exploration.
- Implemented filters and user-friendly layouts to enhance accessibility and usability.
- Applied insights from churn analysis to propose actionable business strategies for reducing customer attrition.
